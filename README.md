### hi there, welcome to my github...

#

i’m christian — here are a few things about me:


⚡️  i’m focused on swift and apple platforms right now, but i work across a range of languages, frameworks, and platforms.

☄️  right now i'm working at [**hyper online**](https://hyper.online). i have 2 apps on the app store - [**quanta**](https://quantavinyl.app) & [**supercut**](https://supercut.vision).

💛  i love thoughtful design, creative interfaces, and building things that feel fun and intuitive to use.

🎉  i participated in and won the swift student challenge in 2020 and 2021.
