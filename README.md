## Hi I'm Christian 👋

#### Some stuff about me:

I like developing stuff especially with Swift. 👨🏻‍💻

I like doing stuff with technology in general. 💻

I like using Apple products. 

I won the 2020 Swift Student Challenge with my PlanetARium playground that uses SwiftUI, ARKit and ML. 🪐

I know a little Python. 🐍

I live in Australia. 🇦🇺

#### Some stuff I'm working on:

A Home Assistant client that was originally a SwiftUI experiment but I actually liked. Hopefully I release it at the end of this year or next year. 🏠 🤷‍♂️

An activity competitions (app)[https://github.com/Activity-App/App] with some other WWDC scholars! 🏃

Always learning new stuff with Apples frameworks and releasing cool stuff I create or find. Especially SwiftUI.
