## Hi I'm Christian ðŸ‘‹

Hey how are you?! Thanks for checking my GitHub. I'm mostly a Swift dev, but also meddle with other languages every so often. Below you will find a few of the things I've worked on. I hope you find them interesting, please feel free to check them out! I won the Swift Student Challenge in 2020 and 2021 with my submissions named PlanetARium and Swift3D respectively, which was pretty cool!
