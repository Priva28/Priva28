### hi there, welcome to my github...

#

I'm Christian and here are a few things about me:


⚡️  i'm focused on swift and apple platforms atm, but have experience across a range of languages and platforms.

☄️  right now i'm working on [**hyper online**](https://hyper.online), and just released my own app on the app store called [**quanta**](https://quantavinyl.app).

💛  i love and have a great appreciation for beautifully designed user experiences and software.

🎉  i participated in and won the swift student challenge in 2020 and 2021.
